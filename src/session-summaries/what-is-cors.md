# What is Cors



In this video, Valentino explains Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and its implications when developing web applications. CORS is a way to let a web application, running in the browser on one origin, have permission to access selected resources from a server at a different origin. By default, browsers only allow access to resources from the same origin (Same Origin Policy). CORS is implemented using HTTP headers.

To understand CORS and the reason for it, you need to understand Same Origin Policy (SOP) which is a policy that is used to tackle Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and the hosts do well to explain this and a host of other topics surrounding CORS.

What youâ€™ll learn:
- What CORS is
- Reasons for CORS
- Same Origin Policy(SOP) and Origins 
- Different kinds of requests.
- HTTP Headers.
- How to implement CORS and more!!
